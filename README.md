# Habitual SwiftUI 

Create a new Xcode project and set the Language to Swift and SwiftUI as the Interface. 

Create the PersistenceLayer, Habit Class, and Date Extensions. These files provide infrastructure for the app. If you completed the Habitual Storyboard app you can copy those files from that project into your project. 

You also need to get the assets used by the project. Copy or import the images for the habit icons into your SwiftUI project. 

## Views to Build

You will build each of the views of the project first with mock-up data. Then you will connect these and make the app function. 

The views you need to create are: 

- HabitList - HabitTableViewController
- HabitDetails - HabitDetailsViewController
- AddHabit - AddHabitViewController
- ConfirmHabit - ConfriemHabitViewController
